This is a simple Java application for creating bilingual word alignments. It was originally written by [Rebecca Hwa](http://www.cs.pitt.edu/~hwa/). I modified it to add some new functionality while working on bilingual word alignments for my research in statistical machine translation in graduate school. A detailed manual for how to use the application is in 'doc/manual.htm'.

Note that I wrote this code when I was not a very good Java programmer so there are things that I would like to fix but I don't have time for. I have gotten multiple requests for the source code of this project
so I am finally putting it up on github. Even though the tool could be improved, it has been used by several other researchers across the world for creating alignments English-Swahili, English-Hindi etc. If you are interested, you can check out the google scholar page that shows who all have cited this tool in their work:
